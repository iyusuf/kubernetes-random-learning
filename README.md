# Kubernetes Learning Modules

This repository is designed to simplify the learning process for various aspects of Kubernetes by focusing on specific features in isolated, independent modules. For example, when learning about persistent volumes, the approach here is to focus solely on that functionality rather than integrating it into a larger, complex Kubernetes application or full distribution setup.

The goal is to make learning efficient by narrowing down each module to a specific Kubernetes feature, allowing for quick and targeted exploration without the overhead of unnecessary dependencies. This enables faster progression while keeping the learning process straightforward. Each module will include any necessary prerequisites, ensuring you have the foundational knowledge required for the task at hand.
